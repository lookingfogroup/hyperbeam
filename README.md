## Agentic Game Development Platform

**Hyperbeam Engine** is an AI-powered fork of Godot Engine that brings Cursor-like AI capabilities directly into game development. Built for the future of agentic development, Hyperbeam combines the robust Godot engine with intelligent AI assistance.

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Features

- **AI Code Completion**: Intelligent code suggestions for GDScript and C#
- **Built-in AI Chat**: Ask questions about game development, get instant help
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: AI understands your project structure and Godot APIs
- **Code Explanation**: Get detailed explanations of complex game development concepts
- **Error Resolution**: AI helps debug and fix common issues
- **Smart Refactoring**: AI-suggested code improvements and optimizations

### ðŸŽ® Core Engine Features

Based on **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)**, Hyperbeam provides a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It includes a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features), so that
developers can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.

## Community and contributing

Godot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine
developers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).

The best way to get in touch with the core engine developers is to join the
[Godot Contributors Chat](https://chat.godotengine.org).

To get started contributing to the project, see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
This document also includes guidelines for reporting bugs.

## Documentation and demos

The official documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org).
