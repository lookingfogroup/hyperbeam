# üöÄ Hyperbeam AI Assistant Guide

Welcome to Hyperbeam Engine - the world's first AI-powered game development engine! This guide will help you get started with the built-in AI assistant.

## ü§ñ What is Hyperbeam AI Assistant?

Hyperbeam AI Assistant brings Cursor-like AI capabilities directly into your game development workflow. It's like having an expert game developer sitting next to you, ready to help with:

- **Code Completion**: Intelligent GDScript and C# suggestions
- **Debug Assistance**: Help understanding and fixing errors
- **Game Design Advice**: Best practices and architectural guidance
- **API Documentation**: Instant help with Godot/Hyperbeam APIs
- **Code Explanation**: Understand complex game development patterns

## üéØ Quick Start

### 1. Enable the AI Assistant

1. Launch Hyperbeam Engine
2. Look for the **AI Assistant** dock in the left panel
3. If not visible, go to `Project > Project Settings > Plugins` and enable "AI Assistant"

### 2. Configure Your AI Provider

1. Go to `Editor > Editor Settings`
2. Navigate to `AI Assistant` section
3. Choose your AI provider:
   - **OpenAI GPT**: Use OpenAI's models (requires API key)
   - **Anthropic Claude**: Use Claude models (requires API key)
   - **Local Model**: Use local AI models (advanced setup)
4. Enter your API key
5. Select your preferred model

### 3. Start Developing with AI

Open the AI Assistant dock and try these examples:

```
You: "How do I create a 2D player character that can jump?"

Hyperbeam: I'll help you create a 2D player character with jumping! Here's a complete example:

```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

@export var speed = 300.0
@export var jump_velocity = -400.0

var gravity = ProjectSettings.get_setting("physics/2d/default_gravity")

func _physics_process(delta):
    # Add gravity
    if not is_on_floor():
        velocity.y += gravity * delta
    
    # Handle jump
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and is_on_floor():
        velocity.y = jump_velocity
    
    # Handle movement
    var direction = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right")
    if direction:
        velocity.x = direction * speed
    else:
        velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, speed)
    
    move_and_slide()
```

This script gives you:
- Gravity simulation
- Jump mechanics (only when on ground)
- Left/right movement with momentum
- Automatic collision detection

Make sure to:
1. Add a CollisionShape2D child node
2. Set up input actions in Project Settings
3. Configure your player sprite
```

## üí° Advanced AI Features

### Code Analysis & Improvement

Select any code in the script editor and ask:
- "Explain this code"
- "How can I optimize this?"
- "Are there any bugs here?"
- "Convert this to C#"

### Project-Aware Assistance

The AI understands your project structure:
- Current scene hierarchy
- Available scripts and resources
- Project settings and configuration
- Used plugins and modules

### Real-Time Debugging

When you encounter errors:
1. Copy the error message
2. Ask the AI: "I'm getting this error: [paste error]"
3. Get specific debugging steps and solutions

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### AI Behavior Settings

```
Temperature: 0.7        # Creativity level (0.1-1.0)
Max Tokens: 2000        # Response length limit
Context Window: 8000    # How much code context to include
```

### Feature Toggles

- **Auto-complete**: Real-time code suggestions
- **Error Analysis**: Automatic error explanation
- **Code Review**: Continuous code quality feedback
- **Documentation**: Inline API documentation

## üéÆ Game Development Examples

### Creating a Simple Enemy AI

```
You: "Create an enemy that follows the player and attacks when close"

Hyperbeam: Here's a simple enemy AI system:

```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

@export var speed = 150.0
@export var attack_range = 50.0
@export var detection_range = 200.0

var player: CharacterBody2D
var attack_timer = 0.0

func _ready():
    player = get_tree().get_first_node_in_group("player")

func _physics_process(delta):
    if not player:
        return
    
    var distance = global_position.distance_to(player.global_position)
    
    if distance <= attack_range:
        attack_player()
    elif distance <= detection_range:
        chase_player(delta)
    
    move_and_slide()

func chase_player(delta):
    var direction = (player.global_position - global_position).normalized()
    velocity = direction * speed

func attack_player():
    if attack_timer <= 0:
        print("Enemy attacks!")
        # Add your attack logic here
        attack_timer = 1.0  # 1 second cooldown
    
func _process(delta):
    attack_timer = max(0, attack_timer - delta)
```
```

### Setting Up a Game Manager

```
You: "How do I create a game manager for score, lives, and level progression?"

Hyperbeam: I'll create a comprehensive game manager singleton:

```gdscript
extends Node

signal score_changed(new_score)
signal lives_changed(new_lives)
signal level_changed(new_level)
signal game_over

var score = 0
var lives = 3
var current_level = 1
var is_game_active = false

func _ready():
    # Auto-load this script as "GameManager"
    pass

func start_game():
    score = 0
    lives = 3
    current_level = 1
    is_game_active = true
    emit_signal("score_changed", score)
    emit_signal("lives_changed", lives)
    emit_signal("level_changed", current_level)

func add_score(points):
    if not is_game_active:
        return
    
    score += points
    emit_signal("score_changed", score)
    
    # Level progression every 1000 points
    var new_level = (score // 1000) + 1
    if new_level > current_level:
        current_level = new_level
        emit_signal("level_changed", current_level)

func lose_life():
    if not is_game_active:
        return
    
    lives -= 1
    emit_signal("lives_changed", lives)
    
    if lives <= 0:
        end_game()

func end_game():
    is_game_active = false
    emit_signal("game_over")

func get_high_score():
    return ProjectSettings.get_setting("game/high_score", 0)

func save_high_score():
    var current_high = get_high_score()
    if score > current_high:
        ProjectSettings.set_setting("game/high_score", score)
        ProjectSettings.save()
```

To use this:
1. Go to Project > Project Settings > AutoLoad
2. Add this script as "GameManager"
3. Connect to signals in your UI scenes
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI Assistant not responding?**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure you have API credits/quota remaining

**Suggestions not appearing?**
- Enable auto-complete in AI settings
- Check if the AI dock is visible
- Restart the editor if needed

**Code suggestions are incorrect?**
- Provide more context in your questions
- Specify the programming language (GDScript/C#)
- Include relevant error messages

### Performance Tips

- Use specific, focused questions for better responses
- Include relevant code context when asking about bugs
- Break complex problems into smaller questions

## üåü Best Practices

### Effective AI Prompts

**Good**: "How do I implement a checkpoint system that saves player progress in a 2D platformer?"

**Better**: "I have a 2D platformer with CharacterBody2D player. I need checkpoints that save position, collected items (coins), and current level. Show me how to implement this with Godot's save system."

### Code Review Workflow

1. Write your code normally
2. Select problematic sections
3. Ask AI: "Review this code for bugs and improvements"
4. Apply suggested changes
5. Test and iterate

### Learning Game Development

Use the AI as a learning partner:
- Ask "Why" questions to understand concepts
- Request explanations of complex patterns
- Get recommendations for best practices
- Learn about game design principles

## üöÄ What's Next?
